I do not require any evidence to refute any claims. I did not accuse you of lying because you were scammed. Yes, you were deceived by fraudsters who established a Facebook page purporting to be me, but it was never my verified page. The reality is that the Facebook page you mentioned was never affiliated with me. Therefore, hold yourself responsible for the mistake of engaging with an unverified, random Facebook account just because the individual used my name and picture but did not have a verified Facebook account. Period.
