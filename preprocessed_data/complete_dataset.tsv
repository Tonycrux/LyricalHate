The reality is that the Facebook page you mentioned was never affiliated with me. Therefore, hold yourself responsible for the mistake of engaging with an unverified, random Facebook account just because the individual used my name and picture but did not have a verified Facebook account.

Havenât responded to Hiphop commentaries in a long minute because the genre has the most vocal ignorants who know nothing about the art style of different artists they speak about.

there are so many Hiphop affiliated execs (rappers ) who sell out their people in contractual greed; one of them you praise on here helps labels buy artists catalogues for cheap simply because if you convert the money to Naira, 
iss plenty.
