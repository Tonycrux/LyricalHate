@PrimeVideo
 and shown in over 240 countries and territories worldwide!

This has been over two years in the making and I must say this is probably one of the most adventurous, fulfilling things I’ve done. 

I feel blessed and honoured not only be making my debut as a lead actor, but to have also executively produced this film.

I honestly can’t wait to take you guys along with me on this next phase of my life and art…. I’m just getting started."

110,29-11-2020,I’m glad you know it’s YOU guys I was talking about. “Because say I quiet no mean say I be fool” - don’t try and turn nigerian media against me to hide your guilty conscience. Ask all the media houses I have great relationships with them. What you did with this is pure EVIL.
111,29-11-2020,🤣🤣🤣 you know how to diss out but you no fit take am when someone speaks up. Struggling brand ke. Even my son bagged more money than your whole company

133,15-10-2020,Close colleagues of mine at Alausa just confirmed that thugs just came to disrupt their peaceful protest. Please spread the word. Our right to peaceful protest will not be taken away. Why use violence against peaceful protestors?
134,13-10-2020,That’s why they must protest with us. We are not their enemy
135,13-10-2020,"I DO NOT, I repeat I DO NOT support POLICE BRUTALITY but I said I would share some thought provoking things because there is a bigger picture here. I think the police force should join us in the fight. I’ve seen pictures of the barracks they live in with their families."
136,13-10-2020,"I’ve spoken to a few in confidentiality about how low they are paid and how they go months without pay but are handed guns to protect Nigerians. While our leaders in the words of
